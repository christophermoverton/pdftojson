# pdftojson
Python Modules to install globally or in your python runtime environment:
-PyPDF2
-spacy

using pip install or environment installer.
PyPDF2 is a critical python library for this program.  
Spacy (a natural language processing tool) isn't really used while I have a basic parsing functioning revolving around its usage, I opted to use re module (regular expression) reading
for pdf text parsing.  
Parsing example furnished is resume specific and isn't case generalized to varying resume types.
